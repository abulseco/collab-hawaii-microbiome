# Connecting Indigenous Culture and Integrated STEM in Hawaii Through Smart AgTech

This repo is a collection of analyses in support of the 'Connecting Indigenous Culture and Integrated STEM in Hawaii Through Smart AgTech' project funded by NSF (https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2342700&HistoricalAwards=false). 

### Sample Information
Samples were collected from five areas around the Waikalua Loko I'a in collaboration with the Pacific American Foundation. DNA was extracted from sediments using a Qiagen PowerSoil kit by students at Windward Community College in November, 2024. The 16S rRNA gene (515F/806R) was amplified and product was sequenced using a MiSeq, V2 300 cycle kit, at the University of Massachusetts Boston. Sequence data were analyzed using the DADA2 algorithm and visualized through Phyloseq capabilities. 

### Who can use this code
These samples and code were produced for educational purposes only. Code is in progress. If you would like to make a contribution, please reach out to Ashley Bulseco.
